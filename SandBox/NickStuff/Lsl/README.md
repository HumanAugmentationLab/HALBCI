# Lsl
ERPPlusOSCLSL- never finished code that would try and combine two paradigms
ERPStateChangeLsl- used ona model trained on Open/Closed Eyes ERP
ERPStateChangeLSl-Not Mine, but I assume it is the same as the last but will move the neato
lslDifference- used to determine the difference between a stream recorded over lsl and one 
that was not (no difference at all)
nickLSLScipt- big ugly script with a lot of stuff commented out that only uses two lines
to read in a stream apply a model and read out the result over lsl
nickWriteLsl- Nothing to see here, move along
readLslNeato- first script to control neato with muse
sampleLsl - testing out whether lsl works
