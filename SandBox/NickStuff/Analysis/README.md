Calculate Jitter-Graph differences between Marker and Stimulation with photodiode
CSP1-Apply CSP to a dataset (home made)
ERPPlusOSC- Apply ERP and OSC to a muse data model trained on the user pressing buttons to
indicate open or closed eyes
getGraphEnobioHz- graph data recorded on the Enobio
ICACopy-perform ICA on data
museERPClose-Train a data on ERP data from muse
museERPVizClose- Visualize the stimulations from the muse with an ERP experiment
nickBCIIVScript- work with the competition data
nickEnobioHz- create a model for the SSVEP data from the muse
nickMuseCloseScript- OG model for training a paradigm on the muse
playWith Enobio- testing out some matlab functions
plotMultTrials- plot function for multiple trials
quickICA- ICA script used to compare pre and post ICA
reconfigJitterPts - better graph for visualizing jitter on the muse?
searchERP - Search for best parameters for an ERP trial
testingVisualization- very helpful script use for a first pass look at data and making sure the photodiode stimulation is working correctly
whereDrawLine- This script will give the accuarcy of a set of predictions between 1 and
2 ompared to an actual state depending on where the cutoff point between
1 and 2 is (e.g. should 1.4 be considered 1 or 2).
