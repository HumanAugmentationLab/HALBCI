# Preprocess
decreaseTrialsFunc- either in order or randomly, reduce the number of trials to see if a model is still viable if trained on less data
nickReconfigTRUY - staer code to add markers to an empty stream for the competition data
nickTestingFiltering- trying to use flt-pipeline
reconfigSNAP - load XDF file and set the markers to 0
refactorFunc - add more markers after a marker to make more examples for a paradigm to train on
refactorMarkersVariable - rafactor until reaching the next stimulation
tryfindStart - find the occurence of the first marker using a photodiode stimulation
