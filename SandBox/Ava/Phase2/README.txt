enobiotests - patchwork Muse processing
entest2 - full pre-processing/ICA, tried to implement to training paradigm (BAD)
ica_epoch_test - testing effect of ICA on all data, all epochs, and high vs. low epochs
ICAclassify - again, messing with ICA subtraction/training process UNSUCCESSFULLY
** manualclass - classify Muse Open/Closed Eye data using Windowmeans for manually defined windows
myepochssvep - playing around with samepochssvep code to do spectral analysis per trial
onsetmark - visualizing when events changed/states switched
** testparadigmsforica - experimenting with paradigms to see which was best suited for post-ICA data
